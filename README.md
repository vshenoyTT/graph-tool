**Perf Sheet Graph Tool**

Create graphs for Tenstorrent model performance analysis. Built using Streamlit for the interface, along with Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib for data manipulation and graph creation.

To run locally, install the requirements from requirements.txt with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, within the directory, run the command `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`. The web tool will open up on a local host port.

The SQL graphs recquire the `tkinter` dependency, installable via brew.
